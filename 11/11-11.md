## Hypertensive heart diseases

Hypertension causes pressure overload and 
ventricular hypertrophy
- systemic hypertensive heart diseases(主動脈，對左心室負荷變大)
- pulmonary hypertensive heart diseases (cor pulmonale)

### Systemic hypertensive heart disease

- Systemic hypertension
- 代償，所以心肌為了面對高壓而增厚
- Concentric left ventricular hypertrophy
  - wall > 2 cm
  - weight > 500 gm
- Microscopic changes
  - increased myocyte diameter
  - irregular nuclear enlargement and hyperchromasia (box-car nuclei)
  - interstitial fibrosis

Prolonged or excessive myocyte hypertrophy --> contractile failure

Clinical presentations
-  asymptomatic
-  ischemic heart disease
-  progressive heart failure or sudden cardiac death
-  pathologic changes in other organs
   -  kidney: renal damage, nephrosclerosis
   -  brain: cerebrovascular stroke, multi-infarct dementia
   -  vessels: coronary atherosclerosis, aortic dissection

### Pulmonary hypertensive heart disease (cor pulmonale)

- Cor pulmonale (肺心症)
- Right ventricular hypertrophy and dilation secondary to pulmonary hypertension

#### Etiologies
1. diseases of pulmonary parenchyma
2. diseases of pulmonary vessels
3. disorders affecting chest movement
4. disorders inducing pulmonary arterial construction

#### Acute
massive pulmonary embolism, right ventricle dilation

#### Chronic
prolonged pressure overload of pulmonary vessels, right ventricle hypertrophy and dilation

## Coronary artery disease (CAD)

### Definition
Ischemic heart disease (IHD), coronary heart disease

Reduction in coronary blood flow

### Etiology
- obstructive atherosclerotic lesions in epicardial arteries (90%)
- non-atherosclerotic cases
    - coronary embolism
    - vasculitis
    - vascular spasm
    - hypotension, shock
    - hypoxemia


### Pathogenesis

- chronic progressive atherosclerotic 
narrowing of epicardial coronary 
arteries
- superimposed with acute plaque 
change, inflammation, thrombosis, 
vasospasm

### Types

#### acute

- angina pectoris
- myocardial infarction
- sudden cardiac death

#### chronic

chronic ischemic heart disease

### Angina Pectoris (Chest Pain)

Paroxysmal and recurrent attacks of substernal or 
precordial chest discomfort caused by transient
myocardial ischemia

#### Types
- stable (typical): >70% fixed chronic stenosing plaque(激烈運動才會有問題)
- Prinzmetal (variable): coronary vasospasm
- unstable (crescendo): disrupted plaque, partial thrombosis, 
possibly embolization or vasospasm

#### Symptoms
- chest tightness, chest compression pain, radiation pain, 
tachycardia
- relieved by vasodilator (nitroglycerin, NO)

### Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack)

Myocardial necrosis due to prolonged severe ischemia

#### Pathogenesis

- coronary artery occlusion (85%): atheromatous plaque changes (erosion, ulceration, rupture, fissuring)
- spasm of normal or diseased coronary arteries (5%)
- emboli
- vasculitis, hypoperfusion (shock)

#### Symptoms

severe crushing substernal chest pain, compression pain, radiation pain, tachycardia, weak pulse, **dyspnea, hypotension, shock, conscious disturbance**

#### Predisposing Factors of Myocardial Infarction
- Obesity
- Smoker
- Heavy meal
- Heavy load
- Cold environment

#### TYPE

Location
- LAD (40%-50%)
- RCA (30%-40%)
- LCX (15%-20%)
- singly or in combination

Patterns
1. transmural
  - coronary atherosclerosis superimposed thrombosis
2. subendocardial
  - diffuse stenosing coronary atherosclerosis
3. multifocal microinfarction
  - microembolism, vasculitis, vascular spasm

### Acute Myocardial Infarction

#### Pathological change

gross and microscopic appearance of an infarct depends on the duration of survival of the patient following the myocardial infarction

GROSS: 23-24hr, Pallor or red-blue
Micro: Wavy fibers, myocytolysis, necrosis

Leakage of cellular components from injured myocytes
- Myoglobin
- troponins I and T (cTnI, cTnT)
- creatine kinase MB fraction (CK-MB)
- lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)

Electrocardiography (EKG) changes

#### Complications
**75% Patient**

- contractile dysfunction (left-sided heart failure)
- arrhythmias
- myocardial rupture (cardiac tamponade)
- ventricular aneurysm
- pericarditis (Dressler syndrome)
- mural thrombus
- papillary muscle dysfunction
- progressive late heart failure

The risk of specific post-infarct complications and the prognosis depend primarily on the infarct size, location, and fraction of wall thickness involved

#### Medical treatment in acute heart attack
- Thrombolytic therapy (fibrinolytic agents)(標準做法)
  - tissue plasminogen activator
  - streptokinase
- Door to needle (D2N)  30 min
- Contraindication
  - previous hemorrhagic stroke
  - known intracranial tumor
  - active internal bleeding
  - suspect aortic dissection

#### Surgical Intervention for Coronary Atherosclerosis

- Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)
  - Door to balloon (D2B)  90 min
  - angioplasty, stent, stent with anti-thrombogenic agents
  - coronary artery dissection, thrombosis
- Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
  - graft vessel: saphenous vein, internal mammary artery
  - thrombosis, surgical occlusion, graft dissection

#### Effect of Reperfusion
- Reperfusion is the restoration of blood flow to ischemic  myocardium threatened by infarct
- Salvage cardiac muscle at risk and limit infarct size

- Induced by restored blood flow in the necrotic myocardium
- Mediated by oxygen free radicals
- Pathologic changes
  - hemorrhage
  - endothelial swelling
  - contraction band necrosis

#### diagnosis

Myocardial infarct is diagnosed by clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and characteristic EKG changes.

Causes of death
- arrhythmias(心律不整)
- cardiogenic shock
- thromboembolism

Mortality rate
- 20% sudden death
- 30-40% die during 1st year
- 3-4% mortality each passing year

## Valvular heart diseases (VHD)

- Stenosis or insufficiency (regurgitation, incompetence)
