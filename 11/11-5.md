### 第一型 Immediate hypersensitivity

立即型過敏反應會在數分鐘內快速發生，主要是由IgE抗體接在mast cell表面上所產生

#### 機制

圖片


1. Activation of TH2 cells and production of IgE antibody. 
	- TH2會產生IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13
	- IL4 刺激B細胞切換至IgE，IL5活化嗜酸性球，IL13刺激上皮細胞增加mucus secretion
2. Sensitization of mast cells by IgE antibody
	- Mast cell上有個高親和力的接受器，針對IgE的 ε 重鍊上的Fc部位有高親和力，叫 FcεRI，eosinophils漢basophils也有，但basophils通常不參與immediate hypersensitivity
3. Activation of mast cells and release of mediators. 
	- mediator分成三類
		1. Vasoactive amines: 從mast cell granule放出來快速活化
			- histamine(造成vasodilation、增加血管通透性等)
			- chemotactic factors for neutrophils and eosinophils
			- neutral proteases(例如tryptase，會傷害組織病清除產生kinins、切開補體)
			- acidic proteoglycans (heparin, chondroitin sulfate，似乎是用來存amines用)
		2.  lipid mediators: mast cell製造 prostaglandins 和 leukotrienes
			- Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2): mast cell 的 COX pathway最多的mediator，會造成bronchospasm(支氣管痙攣)、增加mucus secretion
			- LTC4 and LTD4: leukotrienes，為已知最強效的vasoactive和spasmogenic 的agent，比histamine強數千倍
		3. Cytokines: TNF等等

#### Clinical and Pathologic Manifestations

具有兩個階段

1) the immediate response : 

- stimulated by mast cell granule contents lipid mediators
- vasodilation, vascular leakage, and smooth muscle spasm
- 5-30min

2) a second, late-phase reaction: stimulated mainly by cytokine
- stimulated mainly by cytokines
- inflammation, tissue destruction, such as mucosal epithelial cell damage
-  2 to 8 hours later
- neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes, especially TH2 cell

#### 常見臨床症狀
- anaphylaxi: Fall in blood pressure (shock) caused by vascular dilation; airway obstruction due to laryngeal edema
- Bronchial asthma : Airway obstruction caused by bronchial smooth muscle hyperactivity; inflammation and tissue injury caused by late-phase reaction
- Allergic rhinitis, sinusitis (hay fever) : Increased mucus secretion; inflammation of upper airways and sinuses
- Food allergies : Increased peristalsis due to contraction of intestinal muscles, resulting in vomiting and diarrhea


### 第二型 Antibody-Mediated Diseases

caused by antibodies directed against target antigens on the surface of cells or other tissue components.

#### 機制

1) Opsonization and phagocytosis

phagocytes會表現出可以binding IgG Fc 尾巴和C3 補體的recepter ，並對像是紅血球或血小板等會coating上autoantibodies的細胞進行Opsonization(調理)，
- transfusion reactions
- hemolytic disease of the newborn (erythroblastosis fetalis): IgG anti–red blood cell antibodies from the mother cross the placenta and cause destruction of fetal red blood cells 
- autoimmune hemolytic anemia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia
- certain drug reactions, in which a drug attaches to plasma membrane proteins of red blood cells and antibodies are produced against the drug-protein complex.

2) Inflammation


3) Antibody-mediated cellular dysfunction

### 第三型 Immune Complex–Mediated Diseases

Antigen–antibody (immune) complexes that are formed in the circulation may deposit in blood vessels, leading to complement activation and acute inflammation.



#### Systemic Immune Complex Disease
Acute serum sickness為這種疾病的原型，常見於輸入外來抗體(如馬血清或兔子血清)，分為三個階段

1) Formation of Immune Complexes
- protein antigen triggers an immune response that results in the formation of antibodies
- 1 week after injection

2) Deposition of Immune Complexes
- 器官利用高壓產生其他液體的，容易累積高濃度的immune complex，溶液包含尿液或關節液，所以immune complex disease often affects glomeruli and joints

3) Inflammation and Tissue Injury
Wherever complexes deposit, the tissue damage is similar. The resultant inflammatory lesion is termed vasculitis if it occurs in blood vessels, glomerulonephritis if it occurs in renal glomeruli, arthritis if it occurs in the joints, and so on.

#### Local Immune Complex Disease (Arthus Reaction)

 an area of tissue necrosis appears as a result of acute immune complex vasculitis.Arthus lesions evolve over a few hours and reach a peak 4 to 10 hours after injection, when the injection site develops edema and hemorrhage, occasionally followed by ulceration

#### 常見臨床症狀

1. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)| Nuclear antigens (circulating or “planted” in kidney) | Nephritis, skin lesions, arthritis, others
2. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis | Streptococcal cell wall antigen(s); may be “planted” in glomerular basement membrane | Nephritis
3. Polyarteritis nodosa | Hepatitis B virus antigens in some cases | Systemic vasculitis
4. Reactive arthritis | Bacterial antigens (e.g., Yersinia) | Acute arthritis
5. Serum sickness  | Various proteins (e.g., foreign serum protein) (horse anti-thymocyte globulin) | Arthritis, vasculitis, nephritis
6. Arthus reaction (experimental) 

### 第四型 T Cell–Mediated Diseases

 #### CD4+ T Cell–Mediated Inflammation

 cytokines produced by the T cells induce inflammation that may be chronic and destructive. 

 prototype是delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH)，接觸後約24-48小時繪發作

 classical  T cell–mediated hypersensitivity 主要是Th1 effector，但TH17也可以參與，尤其主要發言物質是neutrophil的時候，TH1分泌主要是IFN-γ的cytokine，之後產生許多delayed type hypersensitivity，啟動macrophage的發炎機制。


#### 常見臨床症狀

- tuberculin reaction(PPD skin test): 藉由mycobacterium tuberculosis(結核桿菌)滅活並濃縮取得的結核菌素皮下注射後看硬塊大小和數量，卡介苗會影響判讀的結果
- granulomatous inflammation(肉芽腫性發炎): CD4+ T細胞會慢慢地由macrophages取代，堆積的macrophage會large, flat, and eosinophilic變成epithelioid cell，之後fuse成giant cells
- Contact dermatitis: may be evoked by contact with urushiol(一種植物當中的毒)

#### CD8+ T Cell–Mediated Cytotoxicity

In this type of T cell–mediated reaction, CD8+ CTLs kill antigen-expressing target cells.

#### 常見臨床症狀(TCELL MEDIATED)
- rheumatoid arthritis
- Multiple sclerosis
- Type 1 diabetes mellitus 
- Inflammatory bowel disease 
- Psoriasis
- Contact sensitivity

### Immunologic Tolerance

Immunologic tolerance is a state of unresponsiveness to an antigen that is induced by exposure of specific lymphocytes to that antigen. 

Central Tolerance:

The principal mechanism of central tolerance is the antigen-induced deletion (death) of self-reactive T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes during their maturation in central (generative) lymphoid organs (i.e., in the thymus for T cells and in the bone marrow for B cells).

Peripheral Tolerance:

1. Anergy: functional inactivation (rather than death) of lymphocytes that is induced by encounter with antigens under certain conditions.
2. Suppression by regulatory T cells: regulatory T cells functions to prevent immune
reactions against self antigens. 
3. Deletion by apoptosis
4. Some self antigens are hidden (sequestered) from the immune system, because the tissues in which these antigens are located do not communicate with the blood and lymph.

Role of Infections, Tissue Injury, and Other Environmental Factors

### Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
SLE is an autoimmune disease involving multiple organs, characterized by a vast array of autoantibodies,particularly antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), in which injury is caused mainly by deposition of immune complexes and binding of antibodies to various cells and tissues.

Spectrum of Autoantibodies in SLE

The hallmark of SLE is the production of autoantibodies.
