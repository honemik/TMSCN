## Structure and function

## Intimal Thickening(neo intima)

- 任何血管受損都會引起
- Endothelial dysfunction or loss
- 平滑肌細胞增生、合成matrix
    - 受cytokines、growth factor、complement factor

## Arteriosclerosis(動脈硬化)

- Thickening and loss of elasticity of arterial wall
    -  Arteriolosclerosis
    -  Mönckeberg medial sclerosis
       -  Calcification of internal elastic membrane of muscular arteries
    - Atherosclerosis

### Arteriolosclerosis(小動脈硬化)

- Thickening of vessel wall with luminal narrowing
- Hypertension or diabetes mellitus-related
- Types
  - Hyaline arteriolosclerosis
  - Hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis

#### Hyaline arteriolosclerosis
- Aged, hypertension, diabetes mellitus
- Homogenous, pink, hyaline thickening of arteriolar walls --> narrowing of lumen
- Leakage of plasma components across injured endothelial cells and increased extracellular matrix produced by smooth muscle cells

Chronic hypertension in kidney
- Diffuse renal ischemia
- Symmetric shrinkage of kidneys
- Benign nephrosclerosis

#### Hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis

Severe or malignant hypertension
- systolic pressure > 200 mmHg
- diastolic pressure > 120 mmHg

Morphologic changes
- onionskin, concentric, laminated thickening of arteriolar wall made by smooth muscle cells resulting in narrowing of the lumen
- necrotizing arteriolitis

### Atherosclerosis(粥狀動脈硬化)

- Intimal atheromatous or atherosclerotic plaques
- Fibrous cap and atheroma

#### Morphology
- Atheromatous plaque, 0.3-1.5 cm in diameter
- Principal components (**dynamic**)
  - cells: smooth muscle cells, macrophages, foam cells, T lymphocytes
  - extracellular matrix: collagen, elastic fiber, proteoglycans
  - intracellular and extracellular lipid

#### Pathogenesis

**Response to endothelial injuries**
1.  endothelial dysfunction, increased permeability, accumulation of lipoproteins
2.  adherence of monocytes and platelet, lipid accumulation
3.  migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cell
4.  accumulation of extracellular matrix and collagen
5.  thrombosis

Morphologic Events and Clinical Presentations of Atherosclerosis(附圖)

#### Major Risk Factors

Non-Modifiable
- genetic abnormalities
- family history
- increasing age
- male gender

modifiable
-  hyperlipidemia
-  hypertension
-  cigarette smoking
-  diabetes
-  inflammation (C-reactive protein)

Anatomic location
- elastic arteries: aorta, carotid, and iliac arteries
- muscular arteries: coronary, renal, popliteal arteries

Complicated lesions
- calcification, ulceration, thrombosis, hemorrhage, aneurysm

Clinical consequences
- chronic narrowing: ischemia of supply organs (heart, brain)
- acute plaque changes: rupture/fissuring, erosion/ulceration, hemorrhage
  - infarction (heart, brain, low legs, intestine)
  - thrombosis and embolism
- weakening of vascular wall: aneurysm or rupture

## Aneurysm(動脈瘤)

Localized abnormal dilation of a blood vessel or the wall of heart
- Character: true, false
- Shape: saccular, fusiform
- Type: atherosclerotic, syphilitic (leutic), infectious, aortic dissection

Atherosclerotic Aneurysm
- Abdominal aorta below renal arteries
- Local inflammation induced destruction and excess extracellular matrix degradation
- Atheromatous ulcers covered by mural thrombi
- Complications
  - obstruction of branch
  - thromboembolism
  - pressure effect, rupture

Aortic Dissection
- Dissecting Hematoma
- Dissection of aortic media
- Intimal tear, false lumen, inlet, double barreled
- Causes
  - hypertension
  - cystic medial degeneration
  - injury
- Complications
  - rupture
  - hemorrhage
  - extension of dissection

## Vasculitis(arteritis, angiitis)

### Etiology
- infectious pathogens
- immune-mediated inflammation
  - immune complex deposition
  - anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic Ab (PR3-ANCA, MPO-ANCA)
  - anti-endothelial cell Ab
- physical and chemical injuries
- mechanical trauma
- toxins

### Giant Cell (Temporal) Arteritis

- > 50 y/o
- Arteries of head, vertebral arteries, ophthalmic artery, aorta
- Fever, fatigue, body weight loss, facial pain, headache
- Nodular thickenings with reduction of the lumen of affected vessels

- Granulomatous inflammation of the inner half of the media of aorta and main branches, mononuclear infiltrate, giant cells, fragmentation of internal elastic lamina
- Non-specific panarteritis with mixed inflammatory infiltrates

### Polyarteritis Nodosa

- Young adults
- Fever, malaise, body weight loss, hypertension, abdominal pain, muscle pain
- Small or medium-sized muscular arteries
- Kidneys, heart, liver, GI tract, pancreas, testes, skeletal muscle, nervous system, skin
- Ulcerations, infarcts, ischemic atrophy, hemorrhage
- Renal involvement is a major cause of death

- Transmural necrotizing inflammation, mixed inflammatory infiltrate, fibrinoid necrosis, luminal thrombosis, fibrous thickening (coexistence of all stages)
- Aneurysmal dilation, nodularity, vascular obstruction, infarction

### Kawasaki Disease

- Young children, infant (80% <4 y/o)
- Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome
- Fever, erythema, skin rash, cervical lymphadenopathy
- 20% develops cardiovascular sequelae
- Delayed-type hypersensitivity, polyclonal B cell activation ( anti-endothelial and smooth muscle cells autoantibodies)
- Transmural inflammation and necrosis of large, medium-sized and small arteries
- Aneurysm, thrombosis

## Varicose Vein(靜脈曲張)

- Obese, women, >50 y/o
- Abnormally dilated tortuous vein
